HelperEye :
HelperEye IOS application has been developed specifically for the blind or people with low vision.  Utilizing the potential of Flickr vision technology and text to speech libraries, this app is intended to assist blinds with everyday tasks, increase independence and generally make things easier.


HelperEye, allows users with low vision to take a picture of their surrounding by a single click anywhere on their IPhone. The picture is atomically uploaded to the Flickr vision cloud and processed in real time.   
The respond containing detailed content of the image is sent back to the users IPhone with a respond time of less than 1sec.

The information of the image content is process based on accuracy-probability and the keywords/tags with accuracy above 80% is spoken (text to speech) to the user.

The result is: “I see a red car”


There are no other applications out there today that do this with computer vision today. Most of the eye-camera solutions are crowd source solution which basically means that it is really people behind the seen that analysis the image and send back image content information. The respond time for these application can be up to 20-30sec.

Thanks to the Flickr vision technology and the fact that it has analyzed over 5 Billions of Flickr images we can achieve the same thing with a high accuracy in less then 1sec.
